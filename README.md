# Canadian Voron thing

While I was browsing through [Voron](https://vorondesign.com/) [Discord canadaland-:canada: channel](https://discord.gg/voron) in hope to find the best local alternative to the dope [official sourcing guide](https://vorondesign.com/sourcing_guide). I saw that so many other fellow Canadian were looking and/or asking for the same thing.  

**This repository primary objectif is to help Canadian source locally or find the most trustworthy (use) internationnal shop.**
