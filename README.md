# **Canada VORON Guide(ish)**

While I was browsing through [Voron](https://vorondesign.com/) [Discord channel canadaland-:canada:](https://discord.gg/voron) in hope to find the best local alternative to the dope [official sourcing guide](https://vorondesign.com/sourcing_guide). I saw that so many other fellow Canadian were looking and/or asking for the same thing.  
 
This repository aim at helping Canadian find where to source locally. It include how many people have *vouch* for their experience with certain shop. All quote are direct copy of a user reply from Discord.

## General "advices" & informations

#### **INFORMATION**  
> **Side note:** I do not want to divide the Canadian traffic between here and the Discord. It's met to be a "bonus" for sourcing in Canada.  
> The Discord will clearly outlive my git (with the most up-to-date information). Experience are copy-paste from user while keeping their identity anonymous.  
>  
> **Side note 2:** Please do not clone (fork) my repository if you don't like how I write it. It will divide even more how Canadian hunt for the best Voron part deal. The best way to help is to open an issue and explain why you would change something. Or clone it and "pull request" (whatevet that thing is) so I can verify what you are contributing (and verify if needed). But if you do want to take the runner position, ask me and I will archive my repository so people will go to your's for the must up to date information.  
> 
> You could always hit me up in discord (DM) for discussion.
