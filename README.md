# **Canadian Sourcing Help for VORON printer**
> NOTE: Title still to be determined. Suggestion is open.

While I was browsing through [Voron](https://vorondesign.com/) [Discord channel canadaland-:canada:](https://discord.gg/voron) in hope to find the best local alternative to the dope [official sourcing guide](https://vorondesign.com/sourcing_guide). I saw that so many other fellow Canadian were looking and/or asking for the same thing.  
 
This repository aim at helping Canadian find where to source locally. It include how many people have *vouch* for their experience with certain shop. All quote are direct copy of a user from Discord.

## General "advices" & informations

#### **INFORMATION**  
> **Side note:** This is a "bonus" for sourcing in Canada. Their Discord will clearly outlive my git (with the most up-to-date information).  
> Experience are copy-paste from user while keeping their identity private.  
>  
> **Side note 2:** The best way to help is to open an issue and explain why you would change something. Or clone it and "pull request" so I can verify what you are contributing (and verify if needed). But if you want to take the runner position, ask me. I will archive my repository so people will go to your's for the must up to date information.
