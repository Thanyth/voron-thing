# **INTERNATIONAL SHOPPING**

- Shop must not have any physical location in Canada  
  *theoraticly a store with a wearhouse within Canada wouldn't be consider international*
- Customer review must be from the canadaland channel  
  *either good or bad experience are welcome, while respecting the discord server rules and regulations*
- No price are shown  
  *except for general pricing (tbd)*
- Store website are __not__ affiliate link  
  *I don't even know how to get an affiliate link*

**INFORMATION**  
The number of user is based on a channel specific search. I probably have missed a few review.  
The number of Serial user is time specific. Meaning at the time of my search, they have been through the process of getting one.  

This section is less "usefull" than the Canadian one. It focus more on reason why to go international than where. But both are feature.
