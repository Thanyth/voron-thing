| B     | V2 (1x)                                                    | <p>they renamed to just Grainger recently...<br>the web search is a bit painful to navigate but they have practically everything, at good/best prices, and $8 flat fee delivery.<br>last time I checked it was cheaper than sourcing from eBay/AliExpress, and you know the delivery date in advance (usually next day for stuff that is stock).</p> |
| C     | V2 (1x)                                                    | <p>100% another vote for grainger, they don't have everything but they have competitive prices with ali, and 2 to 3 day shipping depending where you are<br>And the 7 or 8 dollar flate rate is real nice when you order 45lbs of hardware</p> |
| D     | <p>V1 (1x)</br>V0 (1x)</p>                                 | <p>There really is! Grainger is my goto for fasteners.. I got my plate from *[redacted]*, but I think there are cheaper options out there. Frames, Misumi is the gold standard but they are from the USA and cost on shipping. I got some extra pieces for my build from *[redacted]* Motors.. not really, Amazon, or Ali.</p> |  
| E     | <p>V2 (1x)</br>VS (1x)</p>                                 | <p>The only thing I reliably sourced in Canada was the fasteners at graingers. There are a few people on one of the main build channels that tried sourcing from the states only and it adds a fair chunk the to the cost. Up here our choices are even slimmer and pricier. I think it's *[redacted]* that has a lot of parts  but you're probably going to end up paying 20 or 30% than what you would pay getting it yourself.</p> |
| F     | V2 (1x)                                                    | <p>Grainger is surprisingly cost effective, as long as you want big bags of fasteners (and of course you do!)</p> |
| G     | V2 (1x)                                                    | <p>Grainger if you want to “individually” package your own<br>*[redacted]* also have an Amazon store with similar pricing and you get it in a couple of days.<br>I would buy bulk. The prepackaged stuff from questionable vendors like *[redacted]* is not a good idea. They pack exact amount. If you lose one, you’re screwed.<br>It’s good to have extras. You’ll want to do some mods or future upgrades.</p> |
