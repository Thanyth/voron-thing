| C     | V2 (1x)                                                    | <p>100% another vote for grainger, they don't have everything but they have competitive prices with ali, and 2 to 3 day shipping depending where you are<br>And the 7 or 8 dollar flate rate is real nice when you order 45lbs of hardware</p> |
| D     | <p>V1 (1x)</br>V0 (1x)</p>                                 | <p>There really is! Grainger is my goto for fasteners.. I got my plate from *[redacted]*, but I think there are cheaper options out there. Frames, Misumi is the gold standard but they are from the USA and cost on shipping. I got some extra pieces for my build from *[redacted]* Motors.. not really, Amazon, or Ali.</p> |  
| E     | <p>V2 (1x)</br>VS (1x)</p>                                 | <p>The only thing I reliably sourced in Canada was the fasteners at graingers. There are a few people on one of the main build channels that tried sourcing from the states only and it adds a fair chunk the to the cost. Up here our choices are even slimmer and pricier. I think it's *[redacted]* that has a lot of parts  but you're probably going to end up paying 20 or 30% than what you would pay getting it yourself.</p> |
| F     | V2 (1x)                                                    | <p>Grainger is surprisingly cost effective, as long as you want big bags of fasteners (and of course you do!)</p> |
| G     | V2 (1x)                                                    | <p>Grainger if you want to “individually” package your own<br>*[redacted]* also have an Amazon store with similar pricing and you get it in a couple of days.<br>I would buy bulk. The prepackaged stuff from questionable vendors like *[redacted]* is not a good idea. They pack exact amount. If you lose one, you’re screwed.<br>It’s good to have extras. You’ll want to do some mods or future upgrades.</p> |

I've only been to the Hawthorne location, which I think is smaller of the two, but it is amazing. So many metric screws in stock. Also you you give them a BOM they'll order anything they don't have on hand. Prices were even better than ordering off ali.</p> |

Ottawa Fastener Supply carries anything under the sun (or can order it) and prices range from 0.10 to 0.25 per fastener (full 2.4 set was about 60-65$ in fasteners). Not sure what *[redacted]* prices are like. I'm happy to ship you fasteners from my local source here at cost if you can't find anything elsewhere, just lmk<br>They've been awful with emails. I sent them around 7 messages over the course of a month to coordinate a curbside pickup<br>Got a few answers then radio silence<br>ended up going in and doing it myself</p> |

I'm in *[place redacted]* so not too far, I sent *[username redacted]* some stuff before from a *[competitor redacted]* order.<br>Problem is time vs money</p> |
