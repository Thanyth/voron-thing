**INFORMATION**  
The number of user is based on a channel specific search. I probably have missed a few review.  
The number of Serial user is time specific, meaning at the time of my search they have been through the process of getting one (and received one).  

This section focus more on the user experience (including where) than why shopping locally. For or against it, here it is not the place to debate.
